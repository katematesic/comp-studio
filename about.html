    <h1>About the toolkit</h1>

    <div class="grid-container">

      <div class="item1">    <h2>The power of inclusive co-creation frameworks</h2>
        <p>This toolkit will guide designers, researchers, and community leaders in facilitating more inclusive co-creation sessions and workshops. </p> 
        <p> Traditional co-creation methods are frequently used for the facilitatorâ€™s benefit, and are led from a data-gathering perspective.  </p>
        <p> My hope in providing you with this collection of resources is that it can be a jumping off point for your own methods that suit your specific problem space and the people you are working alongside.</p>
